<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About: spatial-mapper


This project seeks to create an inexpensive and compact alternative to Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) equipment using a sensor accompanied with a rotary mechanism. Through a `TI-MSP432E401Y microcontroller`, `VL53L1X time-of-flight (ToF) sensor` and a `MOT-28BYJ48 stepper motor`, the device can collect 3-dimensional spatial data in within a single plane.
